# JEDI

# Problem Statement

If we buy an digital copy we are totally dependent on the provider as we are the secondary owner of the copy. If the digital application discontinue itself then all our assets and the game gets destroyed and we have no prove that we were the owner of that game thats why we wonâ€™t be able to retrieve it.
Major companies face losses.
Key tampered and scripts activated.


# Solution

We have created a web application that removes the role of digital game distributor. For example If you purchase a game , a particular NFT will be generated to provide the ownership for the user and that NFT further can be used for trading account also.
Company will bite into this scheme as it will have info and thus an additional entry in its database of the new user.
Easier trade and unbreakable promises with smart contracts.
Storing in the blockchain means safe license and hence minimal tampering
