# JEDI

# Problem Statement

If we buy an digital copy we are totally dependent on the provider as we are the secondary owner of the copy. If the digital application discontinue itself then all our assets and the game gets destroyed and we have no prove that we were the owner of that game thats why we wonâ€™t be able to retrieve it.

# Solution

We have created a web application that removes the role of digital game distributor. For example If you purchase a game , a particular NFT will be generated to provide the ownership for the user and that NFT further can be used for trading account also.
